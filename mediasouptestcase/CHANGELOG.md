* `ProducerOptions`: Rename `keyFrameWaitTime` option to `keyFrameRequestDelay` and make it work as expected.


### 3.4.9

* Add `Utils::Json::IsPositiveInteger()` to not rely on `is_number_unsigned()` of json lib, which is unreliable due to its design.
* Avoid ES6 `export default` and always use named `export`.
* `router.pipeToRouter()`: Ensure a single `PipeTransport` pair is created between `router1` and `router2`.
   - Since the operation is async, it may happen that two simultaneous calls to `router1.pipeToRouter({ producerId: xxx, router: router2 })` would end up generating two pairs of `PipeTranports`. To prevent that, let's use an async queue.
* Add `keyFrameWaitTime` option to `ProducerOptions`.

### 3.4.6

* Update libsrtp to 2.3.0.
* Update ESLint and TypeScript deps.


### 3.4.5

* Update deps.

* `Producer` and `Consumer` stats: Always show `roundTripTime` (even if calculated value is 0) after a `roundTripTime` > 0 has been seen.


### 3.4.3

* `Transport.cpp`: Fix RTCP FIR processing:
  - Instead of looking at the media ssrc in the common header, iterate FIR items and look for associated `Consumers` based on ssrcs in each FIR item.
  - Fixes #350 (thanks @j1elo for reporting and documenting the issue).


### 3.4.2

### 3.3.3

* Add `consumer.setPriority()` and `consumer.priority` API to prioritize how the estimated outgoing bitrate in a transport is distributed among all video consumers (in case there is not enough bitrate to satisfy them).
* Make video `SimpleConsumers` play the BWE game by helping in probation generation and bitrate distribution.
* Add `consumer.preferredLayers` getter.

### 3.0.11

* Codecs: Improve temporal layer switching in VP8 and H264.
* Skip worker compilation if `MEDIASOUP_WORKER_BIN` environment variable is given (#309). This makes it possible to install mediasoup in platforms in which, somehow, gcc > 4.8 is not available during `npm install mediasoup` but it's available later.
* Fix `RtpStreamRecv::TransmissionCounter::GetBitrate()`.


### 3.0.10

### 2.6.7

* Fix wrong destruction of Transports in Router.cpp that generates 100% CPU usage in mediasoup-worker processes.


### 2.6.6

* Fix a port leak when a WebRtcTransport is remotely closed due to a DTLS close alert (thanks @artushin for reporting it in #259).


### 2.6.5

### 2.6.0

* Integrate [libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) into mediasoup (documentation in the `doc` folder). Extensive testing done. Several heap-buffer-overflow and memory leaks fixed.


### 2.5.6

* `Producer.cpp`: Remove `UpdateRtpParameters()`. It was broken since Consumers
  were not notified about profile removed and so on, so they may crash.
* `Producer.cpp: Remove some maps and simplify streams handling by having a
  single `mapSsrcRtpStreamInfo`. Just keep `mapActiveProfiles` because
  `GetActiveProfiles()` method needs it.
* `Producer::MayNeedNewStream()`: Ignore new media streams with new SSRC if
  its RID is already in use by other media stream (fixes #235).
* Fix a bad memory access when using two byte RTP header extensions.


### 2.5.5

* `Server.js`: If a worker crashes make sure `_latestWorkerIdx` becomes 0.


### 2.5.4

* `server.Room()`: Assign workers incrementally or explicitly via new `workerIdx` argument.
* Add `server.numWorkers` getter.


### 2.5.3

* Don't announce `muxId` nor RTP MID extension support in `Consumer` RTP parameters.


### 2.5.2

* Enable RTP MID extension again.


### 2.5.1

* Disable RTP MID extension until [#230](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/230) is fixed.


### 2.5.0

* Add RTP MID extension support.

### 2.4.6

* Do not close `Transport` on ICE disconnected (as it would prevent ICE restart on "recv" TCP transports).


### 2.4.5

* Improve codec matching.


### 2.4.4

* Fix audio codec matching when `channels` parameter is not given.


### 2.4.3

* Make `PlainRtpTransport` not leak if port allocation fails (related issue [#224](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/224)).


### 2.4.2

* Fix a crash in when no more RTP ports were available (see related issue [#222](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/222)).


### 2.4.1

* Update dependencies.


### 2.4.0

### 2.3.3

* Fix C++ syntax to avoid an error when building the worker with clang 8.0.0 (OSX 10.11.6).


### 2.3.2

* `Channel.js`: Upgrade `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` to 20 seconds to avoid timeout errors when the Node or worker thread usage is too high (related to this [issue](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-client/issues/48)).


### 2.3.1

* H264: Check if there is room for the indicated NAL unit size (thanks @ggarber).
* H264: Code cleanup.


### 2.3.0

### 2.2.7

* Fix H264 simulcast by properly detecting when the profile switching should be done.
* Fix a crash in `Consumer::GetStats()` (see related issue [#196](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/196)).

### 2.2.5

* Avoid calling deprecated (NOOP) `SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto()` function in OpenSSL >= 1.1.0.


### 2.2.4

* [Fix #4](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/4): Avoid DTLS handshake fragmentation.


### 2.2.3

* [Fix #196](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/196): Crash in `Consumer::getStats()` due to wrong `targetProfile`.


### 2.2.2

### 2.2.1

* [Fix #209](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/209): `DtlsTransport`: don't crash when signaled fingerprint and DTLS fingerprint do not match (thanks @yangjinecho for reporting it).


### 2.2.0

* Update Node and C/C++ dependencies.


### 2.1.0

* Add `localIP` option for `room.createRtpStreamer()` and `transport.startMirroring()` [PR #199](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/pull/199).

* Improve C++ usage (remove "warning: missing initializer for member" [-Wmissing-field-initializers]).
* Update Travis-CI settings.


### 2.0.15

* Make `PlainRtpTransport` also send RTCP SR/RR reports (thanks @artushin for reporting).


### 2.0.14

* [Fix #193](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/193): `preferTcp` not honored (thanks @artushin).


### 2.0.13

### 2.0.12

* Add `handled` and `unhandled` events to `Consumer`.


### 2.0.11

* [Fix #186](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/186): NackGenerator code being executed after instance deletion (thanks @baiyufei).


### 2.0.10

* [Fix #183](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/183): Always reset the effective `Consumer` profile when removed (thanks @thehappycoder).


### 2.0.9

* Make ICE+DTLS more flexible by allowing sending DTLS handshake when ICE is just connected.


### 2.0.8

* Disable stats periodic retrieval also on remote closure of `Producer` and `WebRtcTransport`.


### 2.0.7

* [Fix #180](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/180): Added missing include `cmath` so that `std::round` can be used (thanks @jacobEAdamson).


### 2.0.6

* [Fix #173](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/173): Avoid buffer overflow in `()` (thanks @lightmare).
* Improve stream layers management in `Consumer` by using the new `RtpMonitor` class.


### 2.0.5

* [Fix #164](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/164): Sometimes video freezes forever (no RTP received in browser at all).
* [Fix #160](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/160): Assert error in `RTC::Consumer::GetStats()`.


### 2.0.4
